# Introduction-to-Python
These are my first ever programs in Python. These small projects were made by following along with multiple hours of youtube tutorials as well as applying some of
the knowladge to form some of my own creates like tic tac toe games and. basic algorithms. All these programs are very basic and are meant to illustrate the progression of my proficiency in Python. To see more advanced data science based programs you can check out my DATA 101 repo!
